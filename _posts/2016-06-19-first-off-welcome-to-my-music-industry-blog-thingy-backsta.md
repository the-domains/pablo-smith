First off, welcome to my music industry blog thingy, Backstage. I'd like to use this short introductory post to do my best to explain what I'm doing here, what Backstage is about, and maybe some more. We'll see.

Backstage came from my profession, as an artist manager, to shine some light (no pun intended) on what goes on in the industry behind the scenes of some of the largest pop/music acts you know, as well as give my own personal two cents, and simply to test The Grid and see what it lives up to.

For the sake of my career, I'm going to try to purposefully be vague when I talk about a certain artist to protect their privacy and because 99% of the time, I'll be talking about certain scenarios to highlight a point that in itself has nothing to do with the artist or their actions.

With all that said, let's see what I can make of this, and hope to see you soon!
